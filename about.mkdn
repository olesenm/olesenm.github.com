### This site ###{: class="vlist"}

Born out of necessity (to get github project pages working), I started
a blog in 2009 - primarily note things that would otherwise get buried
in mailing lists.

Since that time, the blog activity has largely ceased and various
other things have also changed.

### About me ###{: class="vlist"}

My background is in [Computational Fluid
Dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics).

In the past I worked with commercial CFD software (AVL/Fire 7,
STAR-CD, STARCCM+) as a user and in method development.
The idea of "method development" is to make software do what _you_
want and, most importantly, to create optimized workflows for
production purposes for yourself and others to use. The best way to
encourage best practices is to make it easy. I call it
_"standardization by laziness"_.
For some of this, STARCCM+ was extended with a custom NetBeans module
with a guided workflow, but one that was also based on a variety of
plain config files for setting meshing and flow properties. I was
fairly neutral about Java, but the absolutely astounding amount of
code that one has to generate pushed me away from it. For other tasks,
Perl played a central role (I consider an excellent tool for data
munging and for a variety of other things, but those particular skills
have largely atrophied in the meantime).

As a further outcome of practicing CFD, which generally requires
parallel processing to achieve acceptable run-times, I configured and
maintained a smallish Linux cluster using GridEngine as the resource
management (queuing) system.

In 2006 I started using OpenFOAM (a patched version 1.3) to explore
extending and/or replacing commercial CFD software with an open-source
solution. This provoked an upgrade in my C++ skills to match.
Since 2016 I have been able to shift my focus entirely to OpenFOAM
(with a corresponding change in jobs).

#### Historical side-notes

- I maintained and enhanced an orphaned
  [rxvt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt) many years ago when my
  underpowered workstation found XTerm to be a memory hog.
- Ever since moving from [VM/CMS xedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEDIT),
  I have been using the [jed editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JED_(text_editor))
  with emacs keybindings.
  The main selling point was its cross-platform availability and that it
  the executable and libraries fit onto a 1.44 MB floppy (doesn't sound
  very relevant any more).
- My first Linux system was a slackware distribution.
  Currently use openSUSE for most systems, with a few Ubuntu laptops
  kicking about as well.
